<p>In VBA IDE we can see the functions Call Stack - the very first on the bottom is the main one. Afterwards, we have got functions being launched subsequently on the top of each other.</p>
  
<p>As the sequence has the stack nature, the first function that ends its work up is at the very top. Another one that ends its work up is the second one that left on the top and so on till the mian function on the bottom.</p>
