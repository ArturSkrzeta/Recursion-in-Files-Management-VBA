# Recursion-in-Files-Management-VBA
Being tried of figuring theoretical examples out of recursion application, I decided to go ahead with applying recursion for walking through folders and converting files.

<p>In VBA IDE we can see the functions Call Stack - the very first bottom is the main one. Aftwerwards, we have got functions being launched subsequently. As the sequence has the stack nature the first function that ends its work up is at the very top and so on till the bottom.</p>
